#Scripts for photogrammetry pipelines

These scripts automate the process of running reconstruction pipelines.

Some steps common to all pipelines are: Structure From Motion, Multi View Stereo,
 mesh reconstruction, mesh cleaning and optionally texturing. 
 
## MVE
One of the few open source projects that offer the whole pipeline in one solution.

*Pro:* All in one, easy to run

*Cons:* The quality is not the best achievable (based on experience and benchmarks)
